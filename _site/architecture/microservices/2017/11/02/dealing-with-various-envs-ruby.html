  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>While this blog was being adapted, I dealt with something that nowadays is a simple and very automated task: environment configuration. I just fell into the simplicity of putting everything in my base laptop, and thus, I struggled to have a “normal” environment for <strong>Ruby</strong> running, as Jekyll is based on Ruby.</p>

<p>So by the time I had something simple ready, I ran the jekyll <code class="highlighter-rouge">serve</code> command so as to put the static site in a specific port, so as to browse locally, and the output was that:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"> edu@edu <span class="o">&gt;</span> ~/Projects/website <span class="o">&gt;</span> jekyll serve 
/home/edu/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p374/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.9.1/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb:55:in <span class="sb">`</span>require<span class="s1">': cannot load such file -- jekyll (LoadError)
	from /home/edu/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p374/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.9.1/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb:55:in `require'</span>
	from /usr/bin/jekyll:20:in <span class="sb">`</span>&lt;main&gt;<span class="s1">'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>After that I assumed that I was screwed and that I was going to last days to know what’s been broken on my system. Before giving up I did a quick research of the output of that command, and seemed pretty common. I installed jekyll from the aptitude package manager, and as it’s also a gem on ruby, out of my desperation I tried to install ruby via its package manager:gem. So after executing <code class="highlighter-rouge">gem install jekyll</code>, the output was the following:</p>

<p>So eventually seemed that my ruby version on my box was old enough to fail when trying to serve a static website. Since ruby was included by default in the box, and many services were dependant on ruby, I could not take the risk of just erasing ruby and installing the new version. I though to have a virtual environment to work in my blog, and I also discovered later that [this is a plausible soliution][vagrantjekyllbox] as in Vagrant Hub there’s a virtual machine for that.</p>

<p>But before thinking that, I searched for a way that the fellow ruby developers could manage their environment easily, as for sur ther could have dealt with a problem similar as mine. And there, I found [RVM][rubyversionmanager]. That, is just the acronym of “Ruby Version Manager”, and it just does that very well. After following the steps they indicate on their website, I was able to see what was my ruby environment status (even when I tried to mess with ruby manually):</p>

<p>After executing <code class="highlighter-rouge">rvm list known</code> I was able to see which ruby version I needed to install. Again, installing a ruby version was really easy by executing <code class="highlighter-rouge">rvm install &lt;ruby_version&gt;</code>. After that, by executing <code class="highlighter-rouge">ruby list</code> a list of available and used versions was displayed. To switch the version of ruby to the one I needed was as simple as <code class="highlighter-rouge">rvm use &lt;ruby_version&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Of course, after that, <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code> was executed properly and I was able to check out the site that you are browsing now.</p>
