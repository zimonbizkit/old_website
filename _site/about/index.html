    <p><img src="../assets/about.jpg" alt="Me in NYC" /></p>
<h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h2>
<p class="about para">
 I'm a software developer based in Barcelona ,Spain. I've been working as a developer/systems engineer for a big variety of companies, and I'm currently employed as a developer on one of the biggest fintech companies in the United Kingdom, with business units in a bunch of countries.
<br />
 My period of scholarship should be the equivalent of the so called <i>bachelors degree</i> on Information Technology in the UOC, which I didn't finish, but intend to do some day. Anyhow, you can contact <a href="mailto:simon.gallegos.edu@gmail.com">me</a> if you want a copy of my resumé.
</p>

<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p class="about para">
Most of the work I do is for Spain but sometimes I do work for the UK colleagues. I'm currently also doing some work on a SRE team that works for all the subsidiaries of the company. 
</p>

<h2 id="what-ive-been-doing">What I’ve been doing</h2>
<p class="about para">
I've been working with web stacks mostly onmy career, but I have also hands-on experience on some embedded software solutions. I mostly worked with LAMP/LAPP stacks. I used PHP as my main field language but I've been also working with other languages too. 
</p>

<h2 id="what-i-plan-to-do">What I plan to do</h2>
<p class="about para">
Since most of my past career has been develop around the web, my interests are shifting towards  distributed systems, and everything that involves a software ecosystem to be more heterogeneous. I strive to work like that in a mid/long term future.
</p>

<h1 id="my-tech-interests">My tech interests</h1>
<p class="about para">
Some of the concepts I'm currently learning from and applying at my current job are:
<ul>
<li> SOLID principles</li> 
<li> DDD</li>
<li> CQRS</li>
<li> Event Sourcing</li>
</ul>
I have a tremendous chance to apply these principles/methods where I work, as I work with knowledgeable colleagues. That's a big part of why I'm keeping my actual job :)

I'm also interested in everything that's related to:
<ul>
 <li> Microservices</li>
 <li> Containers</li>
 <li> CI/CD </li>
 <li> Functional/concurrent programming </li>
 <li> Proper software testing</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1 id="my-intention-with-this-space">My intention with this space</h1>
<p class="about para">
Most of the content II'll be posting here is new to me,so I'll try to keep everything as a register of what I'm learning throughout time. In no way will be my intention to lecture anyone about anything,even less being pejorative about someone/something. I'll try to maintain this in a very unopinionated way 90% of the time, although sometimes it's inevitable :). I believe to keep anything written in this blog, as my own food for thought, and if it serves to you, the better. 


I'll try to adhere to this, and convert it in my own CoC when it comes to writing here :)
</p>

<h1 id="my-other-interests">My other interests</h1>
<p class="about para">
I do other things that do not involve computers. Amongst any other common interests, I enjoy 
<ul>
  <li> Music, drumming: Not in a band anymore because of time, but I've been in a few :)</li> 
  <li> Light mountain hiking/hideouts</li>
  <li> Travels</li>
</ul>
