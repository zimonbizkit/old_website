**The Mythical 'Man Month': Essays on software engineers**
<br>
_Frederick P. Brooks, JR._
<br>
This is a book from some decades ago about software development and organizing engineering and architect teams. But despite being so old, it contains some postulates that are still valid to this day. It's worth a read for someone who wants to understand how teams can behave badly in terms of consecution of tasks, efficiency, featuritis, and so on.

**Introducing Erlang**<br>
_Simon St. Laurent_<br>
Just to begin to shift to functional programming.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
## 2017
**Implementing Domain Driven Design**
<br>
 _Vaughn Vernon_
 <br> 	 
 Dubbed 'The Red Book'. This should be the bible for any DDD practitioner. I was able to arrange a reading club with my team to go over all the book and try to apply the principles that appear in the book. That helped to shape the basic way I'm approaching programming problems now.

**O'Reillys 'Site Reliability Engineering**
<br> 	
_many authors_
<br> 
Needed for my late role of SRE in my previous company. Worth a read to know what's needed to do a very new role very related to the DevOps philosophy.
<br>
<br>
**The Go Programming Language**
<br>
_Brian Kernighan,  Alan A. A. Donovan_
<br>
Just to fill my need of learning my first new systems programming language with hopes to be employed for that in the mid future. 	
<br>
<br>
**Building Microservices: Designing Fine-Grained Systems**
<br>
_Sam Newman_ 
<br>
If you want to stroll away from maintaining monoliths sometimes, this  is obligatory.
