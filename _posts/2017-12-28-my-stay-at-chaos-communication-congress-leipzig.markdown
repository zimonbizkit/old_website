It's not my first time here,but since I'm a newcomer to what's known as having a blog, I'm going to share some thoughts on my stay at the Chaos Communication Congress (CCC) that this year is being held in the city of Leipzig, Germany. As a disclaimer I'll say that I'm quite the oppositte of a hacktivist/infosec guy, but since it's the biggest hacker conference held in Europe, and I know some guys of that profile from an old good friend of mine, I thougt that that's enough excuse to stroll around and go with them.

I'm also neither an expert nor a rookie on alternative Internet protocols/routers, but as the Internet as we know it is becoming more centralized and easier to control by authorities, I thought it could be intereresting to assist to a conference held there, about maintaining an outer TOR relay, and its consequences for both the community and the "maintainer" of that relay. 

So, in first place, and to keep it short, Tor (which is an acronym of "The Onion Router") is a  -describe tor with a few words here-. 

-describe here the implications of having an "exterior" tor relay, and what's the implications for the maintainer-

-toughts on how the community enables the usage of the tor network, and how alternatives come out as experiences are shared by the assistants of the meeting-
